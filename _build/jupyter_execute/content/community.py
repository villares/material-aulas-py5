from py5 import community


# Unlike the py5 library and much of the documentation you see on this
# website, I cannot write Python code to generate a community. It can only
# be fostered through the interactions and efforts of people. The
# Processing Foundation is known for its inclusive and accessible
# community, and I'd like for the same to be true about py5. In my view,
# that means providing everyone, regardless of their background, the
# freedom to learn, experiment, and make mistakes.
# 
# Why is this important to me?
# 
# To answer that question, I'll start by explaining my early experiences
# with Processing and the Processing community.
# 
# Before I first heard about Processing or ITP, I worked in the finance
# industry, mostly doing quantitative research and development. It
# involved a lot of analytical or scientific programming. I had a
# background in math and computer programming so it was a good fit.
# 
# Contrary to what you might think, my programming and technical knowledge
# did not always increase from year to year since I graduated from
# college. Generally it did, but sometimes my skills atrophied during
# times when my work responsibilities did not involve much coding.
# 
# I discovered Processing during one of the times when my technical skills
# weren't that great. And I was getting treated poorly at my job because
# of it. This wasn't constructive feedback; it was demeaning behavior
# that I gained nothing from. It was part of a pattern of how management
# at that company operated. Sadly, the most destructive employees were
# getting promoted, reinforcing cycles of negativity.
# 
# While all of this was happening I was also starting to experiment with
# Processing. First I made simple sketches, and later I moved on to more
# complex animations. In time I created two Processing libraries,
# [Camera3D](https://ixora.io/projects/camera-3D/) and
# [ColorBlindness](https://ixora.io/projects/colorblindness/). My first
# library, Camera3D, took months to complete. I rewrote it from scratch
# several times as I figured out better ways to design and organize the
# code. It was a joy to create both of them, and I learned a tremendous
# amount along the way. It was the biggest thrill when I made each
# publicly available and people in the community started using them.
# 
# The community around Processing fosters experimentation and learning,
# and freedom to experiment includes the freedom to make mistakes. And the
# reality is I made a lot of mistakes while creating both of those
# libraries. Mistakes that, had I been operating in the hostile
# environments I was employed in, would have resulted in the projects
# being taken away from me or simply terminated. The exact same thing is
# true for py5. All of these projects simply wouldn't exist today, which
# would be a loss, both for me, and for the community as a whole.
# 
# Unexpectedly, what I learned through Processing helped me be more
# successful at work, even though all this was years before I met a person
# in real life who had heard of it. Processing helped me build confidence
# in my technical skills at a time when I most needed it.
# 
# I have been thinking about these things over the past year or so as I
# built py5. This won't be apparent to you now, but the code itself is
# modular enough that others will be able to contribute to it without
# first needing to understand the complexities of the entire project.
# Later, I'll start showing people how to contribute by creating py5
# libraries, similar to the libraries like Camera3D that have been built
# for Processing. Eventually I'll also have plenty of documentation and
# tutorials that people can read and start experimenting with. And most
# importantly, this concept of community is going to be a part of how I
# interact with people when I teach people how to use py5.
# 
# Few people learn or grow in a hostile environment. Or perhaps what is
# learned has nothing to do with programming. In any case, I value the
# Processing community because it is the complete opposite of the hostile
# environments I used to work in. I want other people to find
# opportunities to learn and experiment, and make mistakes, just like I
# did. It is from such an environment where new ideas are conceived, new
# tools are created, and new applications are developed, bringing value
# into the world that otherwise would never come to be.
